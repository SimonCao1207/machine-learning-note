# TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

$$TFIDF(t,d,D)=TF(t,d)Ã—IDF(t,D)$$
- $TF(t,d)$ : term frequency of term t in document d, representing how often term t appears in document d. 
- $IDF(t, D)$ : inverse document frequency of term t in the entire document collection D. 
    $$IDF(t, D) = log(\frac{N}{DF(t, D)})$$    
    - $DF(t, D)$ : document frequency of term $t$.
